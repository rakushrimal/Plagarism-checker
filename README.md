# Plagarism-checker

As the technology is growing very fast and usage of computer systems are increasing as compared to the old times, plagiarism is the phenomenon which is increasing day by day. 

Wrongful appropriation of someone elseâ€™s work is known as plagiarism. 

Detection of plagiarism manually is really very difficult so this process should be automated. We can use various tools and techniques which helps in plagiarism detection. Some work on intrinsic plagiarism while others work on extrinsic plagiarism. 

Data mining techniques can be used for the  detection of plagiarism as well as can help to improve the efficiency of the process.

We proposed a scheme for plagarism detection in this project.

This project can be used to build a app which detect the plagarism of student's assignments in universities and colleges.
